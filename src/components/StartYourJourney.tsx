        We are currently seeking reference clients to help refine our offerings.
        You will receive comprehensive consulting services, including research,
        design, and technical integrationâ€”at no cost(*). All we ask for is
        feedback, and, if you&apos;re happy with our efforts, permission to
        either show your logo on our web page, or to refer potential future
        clients to you for private recommendation. (* For reference clients we
        would only charge back expenses, such as travel if the work could not be
        carried out remotely ... And we always fly coach! :-)
